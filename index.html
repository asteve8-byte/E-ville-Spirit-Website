        E’ville Spirit is here to help you find the most amazing Halloween decorations in Edwardsville & Glen Carbon. These homes are a vital part of what makes the Halloween culture so strong here. Some of these spots are legends in their own neighborhoods and some may be tucked away in a lightly traveled cul-de-sac. It’s time to get in the spirit and see them all!
      </p>
      <p class="p-one">So...</p>
      <p class="p-one">
        Explore. Bring your kids. Get to know your neighbors. Build memories. Add some decorations to your home. Visit the Spirit Halloween store (again). Pass out the good candy.
      </p>
      <p class="p-one">
        Instill a love for the spooky side of life in the next generation.

      <p class="p-one">I have always loved Halloween. Growing up, my family was known for our over-the-top decorations and hosted an annual party. My mom was the kind of person who kept her rubber rats out year-round and slapped some Santa Claus hats on them when the time came. I have fond memories of putting together a costume each year and then running amok in the neighborhood, swapping information on which houses were giving out the best candy.</p>

      <p class="p-one">When I moved to Edwardsville with my own family, I was thrilled to see Halloween was a big part of the community culture here. Each year, my neighborhood is swarming with trick or treaters, just like when I was a kid back in the 80s. We go all out with decorations and I love walking around my neighborhood seeing what the other Halloween enthusiasts do with their homes, but I don’t really know what’s happening anywhere else in town. And I want to… and I’m guessing you do too.</p>

      <p class="p-one">So I created E’ville Spirit to showcase a community map of all the best Halloween decorations. I hope that each year I can add some more bells and whistles to this effort—maybe an annual award ceremony at the Wildey with funny “Nailed-It” style trophies or giving away homemade Halloween gifts at local businesses. I hope you’ll embrace this effort and come along for the ride as it grows and evolves over time.</p>
